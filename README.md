MWF Business Management System

MWF is a B2B wood and furniture company dealing in timber, poles, and furniture products. This project is 
a simple management system to help them run operations like sales, stock, and reporting more efficiently.

The system records customer purchases, product details, payment methods, and automatically adds 
a 5% transport fee when delivery is provided. Receipts and sales reports are generated for the manager,

while stock is managed with details such as product type, supplier, cost price, quality, and quantity.
Managers can also update prices and stock levels whenever required.

The project is built with Node.js, Express, and MySQL (backend) and a simple frontend interface.
To run, clone the repository, install dependencies using npm install, and start the development server with npm start.

Planned improvements include dashboards for sales/stock analytics, automated email reports, multiple branch support, and secure user authentication.
